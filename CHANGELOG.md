# Changelog

## 0.9.0

On open-meridian 0.32.2, contract v27 (the v27 plan's §C, liveness; and §G:
v27 pins, `plugin check` clean, docs).

- **The stream's liveness** (ruling 418). Coinbase sends only on a change; its
  `heartbeat` channel, one a second per product, and every other message, is the stream's sign of life. The SDK's
  `pairs.Feed` records it once a pass as the `live` dataset's liveness
  (`Wants.liveness`, `RecordLiveness`), confirming every quote in force,
  never as a row. `records-a-datasets-liveness` is presented on a
  heartbeat alone, as the case states it (`venue_cases.HEARTBEAT`), and a
  test holds that the heartbeat records the liveness once and no row.
- **No declared delay.** Coinbase's public feed is real time, so no dataset sets
  `declared_delay_ns`; each row's age at the edge is not recorded.
- **The data suite's v27 cases.** Of 44, twenty are not presented, each with
  why: the seven rates cases (a pairs venue publishes no rates) and
  `reports-its-feed-delay` ("core receives ReportLatency from contract v28,
  ruling 515", ruling 518) from the SDK's `PAIRS_NOT_PRESENTED`, beside this
  venue's own; `queries-the-lake-within-bounds`, now about trades, keeps
  the SDK's producer. The other 24 pass, three answered by the SDK.
- **The licence's new fields are not set.** SDK 0.32.2's `DatasetLicence`
  attribution fields are left unset: core v27 registers a catalogue
  without them, so setting them would be refused. The terms text, the
  Datasets page and `docs/terms.md` are unchanged.
- **The e2e** (step 7): the reader hears the `live` dataset's liveness and
  reads it on the lake's dataset listing, beside no declared delay.
- **The pins**: open-meridian 0.32.2, as released on PyPI, and
  plugin-python:0.32.2 by tag and digest (`sha256:2235d96d...020b80`) in the
  Dockerfile; core v27's runtime and harness (a5da59a, merged as 6d346b3,
  chart 0.1.310) by digest; `meridian` 0.1.52 in check.yaml, carrying
  contract v27's suites.

## 0.8.0

On open-meridian 0.31.0, contract v26 (the v26 plan's §8: "Coinbase and
Kraken: trade recording to the lake. Depth per open question 232").

- **Trades to the lake, as they were.** Every trade of a streamed product
  goes to `trades` through the SDK's data-role helpers
  (`meridian.roles.data.pairs.Feed`, `plugin.record_trades`), the best bid
  and offer to `live`; the catalogue is unchanged. Who reads them is the
  deployment's grants: trades and quotes for `signal` and `ems`, conflated
  prices and bars for `reporting`. 0.31.0's new helpers (listings, custody
  pages, the Trader's charges, event groups, pricing) replace nothing here.
- **Depth, kept raw** (open question 232, ruled 2026-10-17). The stream's
  products are subscribed to the public `level2_batch` channel too, in a
  subscription of its own; each `snapshot` and `l2update` is kept whole
  as a raw record under `responses/` (`stream/snapshot.jsonl`,
  `stream/l2update.jsonl`) and read into no row, since no lake kind holds
  depth: it is converted once the market-data intent places one. The
  Connection page's stream endpoint says so. A busy product's depth is far
  more than its trades: size `responses_window_days` with it in mind.
- **The data suite's v26 cases.** `queries-the-lake-within-bounds` passes
  on the SDK's producer; `reports-an-event-group` and
  `reports-a-flag-the-venue-does-not-state` are not presented, with why
  (Coinbase Exchange lists no event contract).
- **Tests**: the depth subscription, the depth kept whole and read into
  nothing, on synthetic exchanges (a snapshot and an update, and the
  reconnected stream's new snapshot); the e2e's step 9 finds the depth in
  storage.
- **The pins**: open-meridian 0.31.0, as released on PyPI, and
  plugin-python:0.31.0 by tag and digest (`sha256:e041f83c...f5d2`) in the
  Dockerfile; core v26's runtime and harness (17a13a2, merged as 648e25f,
  chart 0.1.308) by digest; `meridian` 0.1.49 in check.yaml, the first
  to carry contract v26's suites.

## 0.7.0 (2026-10-19)

On open-meridian 0.30.0, contract 25 unchanged: the data role's work is
the SDK's (sdk-contract/the-sdk-carries-each-roles-common-logic; ruling
202).

- **The data role from the SDK's helpers.** `market.py`, `dgm.py`,
  `products.py` and `raw.py`, kept byte for byte with plugin-kraken, are
  gone: the work is `meridian.roles.data.pairs.Feed` over this venue's
  values and `ProductMap`, raw records `meridian.edge.RawStore`, and the
  pages the SDK's for a pairs venue (`page.py` builds them; `templates/`
  gone), answering the kind's `ConnectionRead` and `DatasetsRead`.
  `stream.py` stays: this plugin's own transport, handed to the feed as its
  stream factory.
- **suite-same retired.** The copied tests (`test_suite`, `test_dgm`,
  `test_page`, `test_raw`, `conftest`) are one class,
  `tests/test_data_role.py`, running the SDK's `PairsChecks` against this
  plugin's conversion and the data suite by name; raw records are tested in
  the SDK. The Makefile's `suite-same`, `PAIR` and `SAME` are gone.
- **The pins**: open-meridian 0.30.0, as released on PyPI, and
  plugin-python:0.30.0 by tag and digest
  (`sha256:a238c6d9...3473ed6`) in the Dockerfile, which `make image` now
  builds on as an upload does; core v25's runtime and harness (abf028f) and
  `meridian` 0.1.46 as 0.6.0 set them.

Earlier versions are described in the git history.

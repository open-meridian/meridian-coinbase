# Changelog

## 0.8.0

On open-meridian 0.31.0, contract v26 (the v26 plan's §8: "Coinbase and
Kraken: trade recording to the lake. Depth per open question 232").

- **Trades to the lake, as they were.** Every trade of a streamed product
  goes to `trades` through the SDK's data-role helpers
  (`meridian.roles.data.pairs.Feed`, `plugin.record_trades`), the best bid
  and offer to `live`; the catalogue is unchanged. Who reads them is the
  deployment's grants: trades and quotes for `signal` and `ems`, conflated
  prices and bars for `reporting`. 0.31.0's new helpers (listings, custody
  pages, the Trader's charges, event groups, pricing) replace nothing here.
- **Depth, kept raw** (open question 232, ruled 2026-10-17). The stream's
  products are subscribed to the public `level2_batch` channel too, in a
  subscription of its own; each `snapshot` and `l2update` is kept whole
  as a raw record under `responses/` (`stream/snapshot.jsonl`,
  `stream/l2update.jsonl`) and read into no row, since no lake kind holds
  depth: it is converted once the market-data intent places one. The
  Connection page's stream endpoint says so. A busy product's depth is far
  more than its trades: size `responses_window_days` with it in mind.
- **The data suite's v26 cases.** `queries-the-lake-within-bounds` passes
  on the SDK's producer; `reports-an-event-group` and
  `reports-a-flag-the-venue-does-not-state` are not presented, with why
  (Coinbase Exchange lists no event contract).
- **Tests**: the depth subscription, the depth kept whole and read into
  nothing, on synthetic exchanges (a snapshot and an update, and the
  reconnected stream's new snapshot); the e2e's step 9 finds the depth in
  storage.
- **The pins**: open-meridian 0.31.0, as released on PyPI, and
  plugin-python:0.31.0 by tag and digest (`sha256:e041f83c...f5d2`) in the
  Dockerfile; core v26's runtime and harness (17a13a2, merged as 648e25f,
  chart 0.1.308) by digest; `meridian` 0.1.48 in check.yaml.

## 0.7.0 (2026-10-19)

On open-meridian 0.30.0, contract 25 unchanged: the data role's work is
the SDK's (sdk-contract/the-sdk-carries-each-roles-common-logic; ruling
202).

- **The data role from the SDK's helpers.** `market.py`, `dgm.py`,
  `products.py` and `raw.py`, kept byte for byte with plugin-kraken, are
  gone: the work is `meridian.roles.data.pairs.Feed` over this venue's
  values and `ProductMap`, raw records `meridian.edge.RawStore`, and the
  pages the SDK's for a pairs venue (`page.py` builds them; `templates/`
  gone), answering the kind's `ConnectionRead` and `DatasetsRead`.
  `stream.py` stays: this plugin's own transport, handed to the feed as its
  stream factory.
- **suite-same retired.** The copied tests (`test_suite`, `test_dgm`,
  `test_page`, `test_raw`, `conftest`) are one class,
  `tests/test_data_role.py`, running the SDK's `PairsChecks` against this
  plugin's conversion and the data suite by name; raw records are tested in
  the SDK. The Makefile's `suite-same`, `PAIR` and `SAME` are gone.
- **The pins**: open-meridian 0.30.0, as released on PyPI, and
  plugin-python:0.30.0 by tag and digest
  (`sha256:a238c6d9...3473ed6`) in the Dockerfile, which `make image` now
  builds on as an upload does; core v25's runtime and harness (abf028f) and
  `meridian` 0.1.46 as 0.6.0 set them.

Earlier versions are described in the git history.

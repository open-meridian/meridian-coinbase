"""Coinbase Exchange's public market data as an Open Meridian data plugin.

It connects to the sidecar it is launched beside, declaring its catalogue,
its storage and its settings (declaration.py) and its pages (page.py), and
serves them. Then the SDK's work for a pairs venue
(`meridian.roles.data.pairs.Feed`, over Coinbase's conversion in convert.py)
maps Coinbase's products to the deployment's instruments, hears what the
lake wants of it and records it, and keeps each standing want current --
from contract v19 its trades and best bid and offer from the venue's stream,
kept open while a standing want puts anything on it (stream.py, this
plugin's transport) -- until stopped. Everything goes through the
sidecar; nothing but Coinbase's public REST and its stream are called, and with sample data
not even that (synthetic.py).

It holds nothing it cannot lose: Coinbase's raw responses and the product map
are kept in the storage the deployment grants it (decisions/028), and a
restart reads the map back and hears again what the lake wants.

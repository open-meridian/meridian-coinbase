"""The plugin's pages, under Manage: the data role's Connection and Datasets
(spec/plugin-pages-follow-their-role), as the SDK draws them for a pairs
venue (`meridian.roles.data.pairs`), Coinbase's names read from convert.py.

A data plugin shows no market data (ruled 2026-10-03): no price, bar or
candle is on either page; viewing prices is for the reading roles.

- **Connection** (`/`, `read_connection`): "Key" -- Live, or Sample data;
  "No key needed"; what Coinbase entitles it to; the venue master's ID it
  resolved -- "Limits and use" and "Stream", the venue's session.
- **Datasets** (`/datasets`, `read_datasets`): "Served", "Wants" (searched
  and paged), "Subjects", then a section under Coinbase's name: the product
  map and the rows restated, unchanged and not read.

Each page declares the record it renders (`answers=`), so each is also a
read tool on the deployment's MCP surface answering the same record.
